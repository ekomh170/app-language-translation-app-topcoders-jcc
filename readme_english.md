## Development Practice Challenge: Building a Language Translation App

This Language Translate app is an app that works to translate texts and websites from one language to another. and my goal is to make this to complete the challenge of jabar coding camp (jcc).

## Technology Used

- Native PHP (Version 7.4)
- Google Fire
- Bootstrap 5

## Simplified Language Translation Application Explanation

- I made this translation application like google translate but simpler because for the UI it uses bootstrap 5 and the native PHP programming language. and I made a web translation and clicked on the translation.<br><br>

- for web translation use like google translate, select the input language you want to use to translate, then select the language you want to translate. and after that enter the word you want to translate. done.<br><br>

- for translation cli it will translate the file it is in, (directory) named "bahan_file_translate/text".
